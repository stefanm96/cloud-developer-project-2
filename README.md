I changed the standard "image_url"-parameter, since the old one is not available anymore.

BeansTalk-App-URL: "http://image-filter-service-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/"

Test-URL: "http://image-filter-service-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://dummyimage.com/300/09f/fff.jpg"
